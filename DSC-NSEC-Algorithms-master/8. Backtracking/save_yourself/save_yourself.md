# Save Yourself

**Difficulty: Hard**

The impostors love palindromic strings. So much that they have declared that they would reduce the killing of crewmates if their puzzle can be solved. They have given a word S and have asked you to partition the string into substrings, such that all the substrings are palindrome. They have asked you to print all possible partitions of the string.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases T. T test cases follow
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
- The next line contains a string S

## Output

- For each test case, print all possible palindrome partitions of S

## Example Input

2 <br/>
aab <br/>
nitin

## Example Output

aa b <br/>
a a b <br/>
n i t i n <br/>
n iti n <br/>
nitin
