# Push Zero

**Difficulty: Easy**

The impostors love the digit 0. In order to create problems for them, you have been given N integers and your task includes pushing all the zeroes to the end of the arrangement of numbers, not disturbing the arrangement of the non-zero integers.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases T. T test cases follow
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
- The next line contains N space separated integers

## Output

- For each test case, print N space separated integers such that all the zeroes are at the end of the arrangement

## Example Input

2 <br/>
5 <br/>
1 0 2 0 3 <br/>
6 <br/>
0 5 6 9 0 3 <br/>

## Example Output
