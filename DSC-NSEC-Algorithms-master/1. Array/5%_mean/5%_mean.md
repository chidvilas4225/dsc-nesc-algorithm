# 5% mean

**Difficulty: Easy**

One of the tasks as a crewmate involves finding out the mean of N integers. But to make the task interesting, the Space Mission co-ordinator gave it a little twist. The new task involves calculating the mean of remaining integers after removing the smallest 5% and largest 5% of the elements. Help the co-ordinator complete the task to reduce the chances of the impostors to win.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases T. T test cases follow
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
- The next line contains N space separated integers

## Output

- For each test case, print the mean of the remaining integers after removing the smallest 5% and largest 5% of the elements.
