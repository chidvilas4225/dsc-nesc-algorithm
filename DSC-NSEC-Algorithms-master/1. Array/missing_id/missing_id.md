# Missing Id

**Difficulty: Easy**

All the impostors are identified using an id number starting from 1. The ids are arranged in a stack in the security. Stack 1 contains only 2 ids, 1 and 2. Stack 2 onwards there are x ids in each stack, ie, stack 2 onwards there are (x+3) to (2x+2) ids in each stack. <br/>
The impostors have stolen the id of the Nth crewmate to create mess in the Space Station. <br/>
You have been assigned the task to find out the stack number of the stolen id.
